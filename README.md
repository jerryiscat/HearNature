# HearNature
Developer: Jasmine Zhang

## Purpose of your app
This is an app that allows users to upload nature sounds and browse the sounds. This is designed for everyone, especially for those who love nature and want to record the good moments.

## Screen Descriptions:

**Home Screen: **
On the home page, users can add a new nature sound, choose the categories and turn on/off their location. Also, since the users can record the sound, this may need MediaRecorder and Camera API. 

**Category screen:**
This screen includes all the categories of nature sound. All the sounds will be grouped into these categories. 

**Specific category screen:**
This is the screen that you chose from the Category screen. This will show the sound list in that category. 

**Info Page:**
This page is the introduction and information about the app.

## SUS testing
We use **SUS testing questionnaires** for participants. SUS testing can help developers/businesses to know the learnability and usability of the application. There are **10 questions** in total, and each question is rated on **5 point scale** from strongly disagree to strongly agree. 

The **average SUS score** is 75.6, which is higher than the average of 68. Based on the system usability score below, we can consider the usability score of this app to be good and acceptable, but there are still many spaces I can improve and work on. 

I think the learnability affects the overall usability, since the overall system  usability is 75.6, while the usability Subscore is 77, and the  learnability score is 72. This means that the lower learnability score leads to my lower overall system  usability. This definitely encourages me to** improve the learnability** aspects of my app.
